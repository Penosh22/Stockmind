At the 2024 Goldman Sachs (GS) Communacopia and Technology Conference, Yahoo Finance reporter Madison Mills sits down with Amazon (AMZN) Web Services CEO Matt Garman to discuss the company's AI strategy. Garman emphasizes that AI is \"growing very rapidly\" at AWS, already generating multi-billion dollar revenues. He highlights AWS's diverse monetization streams, including selling AI models, providing infrastructure, and offering services for training large language models. \"This is a technology that has such huge potential to deliver massive gains for enterprises, for start-ups, and for customers of all sizes,\" Garman told Yahoo Finance, stressing that their current business model allows them to thrive financially of AI.

The changes would require the country's biggest banks to boost their capital reserves by an aggregate of 9%. To discuss the implications of these proposals, Catalysts welcomes Chairman of Whalen Global Advisors Chris Whalen. Whalen argues that the focus of this regulatory effort should have been on market risks rather than capital. He points out that since the Supreme Court overturned the \"Chevron deference\" doctrine, which previously gave regulatory agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting ambiguous laws, federal regulators are now more \"vulnerable to losing in court\" if banks choose to challenge their decisions legally. \"The large banks are not happy seeing a 25% increase in capital [reserves] because they don't need it. These banks are giving back capital to investors every quarter. In fact, they would like to give back more. The banks are under-levered in terms of opportunity,\" Whalen tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, \"So I think that the regulators are still not looking forward to future risks, they're looking behind.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

He explains that after the 2008 recession, tech companies came out with cloud products, which eventually became \"the catalyzing force for the tech industry.\" He notes that for real growth, there needs to be innovation alongside economic improvement: \"It's not as easy as saying lower rates are good. I mean, they're kind of the first lift. It's the primer. The next thing, it has to be followed by real innovation.\" At this moment for tech, he believes \"this game is about capital.\" Cloud, just like AI, was \"capital-intensive,\" Rangan explains, and if companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) hadn't listened to investors, he argues that they wouldn't have the massive cloud businesses they have today. He adds, \"Now we're augmenting human capital, I don't know, $20, $30 trillion? That installed base of human capital is far more valuable. That's cognition capital than compute capital.

AI future: Analyst</h3> <p class=\"clamp yf-1e4au4k\">Shares of Oracle (ORCL) are climbing after the company posted better-than-expected first quarter results and announced partnerships with tech giants Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). Moor Insights &amp; Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking for a Trend to dig into the earnings and discuss how the company stands to benefit from the AI race. Moorhead says that Oracle is \"on a roll,\" and that the partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is monumental as \"these two companies have been essentially at war with each other since AWS was formed 15 years ago.\" Combined with the Google partnership, he explains that the \"Oracle database is very much alive and well, and their enterprise customers are demanding it.\" He believes that the jump in the stock is justified, arguing, \"There was this standoff that was happening for 10 or 15 years between Oracle and these classic cloud providers. And what they see is that enterprises want Oracle. They're not going to dump their Oracle database and just shift over to a cloud database.\" He notes that Oracle is the only company that focuses solely on commercial customers, while other names like Amazon have both commercial and consumer plays. \"Where Oracle has been exceptionally strong has been in the largest enterprise governments that require the most security mission critical environments and very highly regulated,\" he adds. Moorhead highlights three facets of cloud enterprises for the company: its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), SaaS (Software as a Service) segment, and its commercial business. \"On a scale basis, they're doing quite well,\" he says. As AI becomes more of a priority, Moorhead notes that data will be the company's biggest play. He explains, \"The biggest obstruction from enterprises going hardcore into AI is the data problem. It's getting the data right. It's co-mingling the right data to give generative AI the right solutions without leaking confidential information.

The sector saw a shaky August as Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) both topped earnings estimates, but ultimately failed to wow Wall Street. \"I believe this is a market that will grow to $400 billion by 2027, which is huge. And it is an AI supercycle,\" Su tells Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia &amp; Technology Conference. \"We're making big bets now for the next five years. And the key is there's no one-size fits-all in this technology race. It's all about end-to-end AI.\" Su expands upon the performance of AMD's latest hardware, calling the chipmaker's MI300X GPU accelerator \"the fastest growing product that we've ever seen at AMD\" since its launch last year. She cites AMD's \"accelerated\" AI roadmap as a catalyst for its product pipeline. \"When we look at how fast AI is moving and how fast the models are moving, we need to have the latest and greatest technology every year. So we actually are now on a one year cadence of new products. So later this year, we're going to announce a new product, our MI325. Next year we'll have an MI350 series, in 2026 an MI400 series. So you're going to get to know AMD products really well.\" Su also touches on AMD's M&amp;A activity in the last several years as the industry attempts to expand the AI chip infrastructure in the United States. When asked about the state of the US chip infrastructure, Su says the chip sector is \"in a place where we must have geographic diversity\" as both public and private investors push more capital into the space.
